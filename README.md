# WP_Media_Library_API_with_Playlists

## A plugin to expose media library items as an API and manage playlists.

The plug-in exposes the media library as a JSON file. The JSON file acts like a sequential playback file. The media files serve as the frames of the playback sequence. Any media file in the media library can serve as a frame in the series. Each sequence frame has its own Escape URL, which can lead to just any other URL on the internet. If the Escape URL is not activated, the frame disappears, and the next frame appears in the user's experience.
