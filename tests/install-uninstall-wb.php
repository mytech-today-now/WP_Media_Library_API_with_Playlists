// Placeholder for installation check in a fresh setup

// Test the uninstallation process and ensure all data and settings related to the plugin are removed
echo 'Testing the uninstallation process:\n';
// uninstall_plugin();
// Placeholder for uninstallation check

// Check the behavior of the plugin when re-installed after uninstallation
echo 'Checking the behavior of the plugin when re-installed after uninstallation:\n';

// Test the installation process with other plugins already installed

// Note: These tests require a more complex setup, including a mock WordPress environment and potentially other plugins. The actual implementation would depend on the specific installation and uninstallation procedures of the plugin.
